# Customer Profile

### 1️⃣ **"Premium Peter" – your high-value, done-for-me customer archetype**

**"Premium Peter"** is a 50-to-68-year-old, South-of-England retiree/ex-exec with deep pockets who wants a yacht-grade electrical system professionally spec'd, documented, and shipped ready to bolt in—so he never has to touch a crimp tool. He values proven brands, safety compliance, and white-glove service over price, and he'll happily pay for lifetime support and a vetted installer. Winning Peter means showcasing uncompromising quality, clean aesthetics, and turnkey convenience.

**Core mindset:** *"I'll pay for the best once, so I never worry later."* Time-poor, quality-maximiser, safety-conscious.

**Tone & messaging:** Confident, engineering-grade, but service-oriented. E.g., "Marine-grade power, expertly configured and delivered to your driveway."

### 2️⃣ **"Remote Rowan" – your freedom-loving, tech-forward customer archetype**

**"Remote Rowan"** is a 28-to-45-year-old remote professional or solo-preneur who works and adventurers from rural cottages and campervans, relying on Starlink, drones, and power-hungry laptops. Productivity, uptime, and flexible living drive every purchase, so Rowan seeks a pre-engineered Victron kit with rock-solid runtime data, tidy wiring, and room to expand solar later—then loves to share the setup with followers. Speak in pragmatic, tech-savvy language, offer calculators and install credit, and you'll earn both the sale and authentic creator content.

**Mindset:** *"Work anywhere. Play harder. Show the journey."* Optimises for flexibility, uptime, and content quality.

**Tone & messaging:** Pragmatic, results-driven, slightly adventurous. E.g., "Ship-grade lithium power that keeps the edits exporting long after sunset."
